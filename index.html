            <h1> About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a student currently enrolled in Oakland Community College <br>with a plan to enroll in either Kettering
                    or Grand Valley State University.<br> I'm a Computer Science major I've been playing around with game design 
                    <br>I've have helped my friends make a few games that are still in development,<br> I'm working on AI design for one of them 
                    and a basic car model for the other. <br>On top of that I'm also working on card games with working and smart AI.<br>

            <h2>Goblin Game</h2>
            <h3>Colony Sim, City Builder</h3>
            <p>This is a game where you play as a colony of Goblins working together to ensure their survival<br> whether it be from opposing clans or the environment itself.</p>
            <p>
                In this game I've made a camera movement script, implemented animations
                <br> to the goblin axe swing and made unit selection possible.
